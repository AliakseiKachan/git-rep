Even though we know, yeah,
We know,
Our time has almost come,
We're all overdue.
Can there be a place to call our own?
Can there be a road that takes us home?

We toe the line (toe the line).
We go along (we go along).
We toe the line
To you now.

When it rains it pours
Like summer storms, the skies as grey as leaves.
The rivers flood the banks and spill into the streets.
But the people laughed and swore that they'd restore
The city piece by piece.
And then the clouds gave way as if to agree;
When it rains it pours.

The mystery unknown now unfolds,
The life that we once owned, first bought, then sold.
Like messengers of war, we've no control.
To oceans unexplored,
This ship sails through.

We toe the line (toe the line).
We go along (we go along).
We toe the line
To you now.
